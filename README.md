 23 WHEN I scroll down
 24 THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
 25 WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
 26 THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present,     or future
 27 WHEN I click into a timeblock
 28 THEN I can enter an event
 29 WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
